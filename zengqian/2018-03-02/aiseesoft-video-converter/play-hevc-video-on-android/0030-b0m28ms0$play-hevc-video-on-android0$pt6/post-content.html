<div class="atpl-post-description-part-2">How can I play HEVC files on Samsung Galaxy Ace 4?</div><p>"I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Samsung Galaxy Ace 4 and it failed terribly. Does Samsung Galaxy Ace 4 come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Samsung Galaxy Ace 4 on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."</p>

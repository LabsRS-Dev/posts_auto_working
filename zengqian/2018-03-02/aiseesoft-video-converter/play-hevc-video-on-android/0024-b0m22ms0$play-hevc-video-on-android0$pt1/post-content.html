<div class="atpl-post-description-part-1"><p>If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Samsung Z, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Samsung Z cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Z would be a workable solution.</p></div>

<div class="atpl-post-description-part-1"><p>If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Samsung Galaxy S9+, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Samsung Galaxy S9+ cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy S9+ would be a workable solution.</p></div>

If that’s the case, we would recommend converting the movie to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy S9+ first, such as H.264 AAC encoded MP4, which Samsung Galaxy S9+ will recognize and handle well.

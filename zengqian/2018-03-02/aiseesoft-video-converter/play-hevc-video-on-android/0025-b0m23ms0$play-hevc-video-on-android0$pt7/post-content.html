<div class="atpl-post-description-part-1"><p>If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Samsung Galaxy Core Lite, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Samsung Galaxy Core Lite cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy Core Lite would be a workable solution.</p></div>

<p class="atpl-post-device-model-description">The Samsung Galaxy Core Lite is a single SIM (GSM) smartphone that accepts a Regular-SIM. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, NFC, 3G and 4G. Sensors on the phone include Proximity sensor and Accelerometer.</p>
<p class="atpl-post-device-brand-description">Founded back in 1969 as Samsung Electric Industries, Suwon, South Korea-headquartered Samsung Electronics today makes everything from televisions to semiconductors. It released its first Android smartphone in 2009, and can be credited with the launch of the first Android tablet back in 2010. The company is among the biggest players in the smartphone market in the world. It has recently developed smartphones running Tizen OS, as an alternative to its Android-based smartphones. </p>
